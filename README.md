The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

1) Present the overall approach of the analysis.

2) Indentify the missing data and use an appropriate method to deal with it.

3)Identify if there are outliers in the dataset. Also, mention why do you think it is an outlier. Again, remember that for this exercise, it is not necessary to remove any data points.

4) Identify if there is data imbalance in the data. Find the ratio of data imbalance.


5) Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc. in business terms.

6) Find the top 10 correlation for the Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable). Note that you have to find the top correlation by segmenting the data frame w.r.t to the target variable and then find the top correlation for each of the segmented data and find if any insight is there. Say, there are 5+1(target) variables in a dataset: Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Target. And if you have to find top 3 correlation, it can be: Var1 & Var2, Var2 & Var3, Var1 & Var3. Target variable will not feature in this correlation as it is a categorical variable and not a continuous variable which is increasing or decreasing.

7) Include visualizations and summarize the most important results in the presentation. You are free to choose the graphs which explain the numerical/categorical variables. Insights should explain why the variable is important for differentiating the clients with payment difficulties with all other cases.
